WEATHER FORECAST :

1) Predicting the max temperature for tomorrow in the city of SEATTLE,WA using one year of past weather data.
2) ML Classifier used : Random forest regression (scikit-learn)
3) Dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pko9oRmCllAxipZoa3aoztGZfPAD2iwj/view?usp=sharing

Workflow :

1) State the question and determine required data
2) Acquire the data in an accessible format
3) Identify and correct missing data points/anomalies as required
4) Prepare the data for the machine learning model
5) Establish a baseline model that you aim to exceed
6) Train the model on the training data
7) Make predictions on the test data
8) Compare predictions to the known test set targets and calculate performance metrics
9) If performance is not satisfactory, adjust the model, acquire more data, or try a different modeling technique
10) Interpret model and report results visually and numerically
